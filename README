This project is a fork of http://sourceforge.net/projects/gimponosx/

Many thanks to Simone Karin Lehmann for his Gimp on OS X project, which 
I used for years. This fork uses just the Gimp-app-template and 
gimp-launcher portions of his project but simplifies to build entirely
in Xcode 4. The macports dependencies are removed.

- gimp-2.8 is expected to be already on the system. "brew install gimp" 
  is nearly ready for primetime.

- the launcher scripts are updated to no longer use the /tmp/skl
  work directory

- the scripts are updated to use dbus-1.4's launchd support, so
  a dbus-daemon is not started anymore. See: brew install d-bus
