# This is your personal gtkrc file.  Any variable defined in this file takes
# precedence over the value defined in the system-wide gtkrc:
# /tmp/skl/Gimp.app/Contents/Resources/etc/gtk-2.0/gtkrc
# 
# This is the formula to calculate the font size for GIMP's menus
# font_size = (72 / X11_dpi) * 13
#
# X11_dpi is the dpi value your X11 is set to. Since 10.5.7 this is by default: 96 dpi
# to change the dpi setting open Terminal.app and type
#     defaults write org.x.X11 dpi -int <new-dpi-value>
# BTW, the default font size for Mac OS X is 13 pixel.
#
# X11 set to 96 dpi
# gtk-font-name = "Lucida Grande 9.8"
# X11 set to 113 dpi 
# gtk-font-name = "Lucida Grande 8.3"
