# This script is only needed, because:
# we want gegl to use Application Support/Gimp to store it's config files
# and gegl starts before gimp launches. 
# Same is for the script "help-locales"
# gimp only create these dirs on the first startup, if _no_ 
# "Application Support/Gimp" exists. So we have to solve this by manually
# create the dirs.
#
# This script swill create the dirs if they are not present. So it will fix the misbehaviour
# (no directories at all) in previous GIMP on OS X versions
# The script can be removed some day, if we can make sure, that all old installation
# prior to 2.6.5 have been updated...
